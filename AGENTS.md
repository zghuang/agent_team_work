# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## Team Roles (from Project Working Agreement)

- **Owner/Boss**: Decision maker, defines vision, approves scope changes and releases
- **Coordinator**: Product Manager + Scrum Master, creates GitHub Issues, prioritizes backlog, assigns tasks
- **Senior Developer**: Tech lead, owns architecture, reviews PRs, enforces standards
- **Developer**: Implements assigned issues, writes unit tests
- **Tester (me)**: Validates features, writes test cases, reports bugs, can block release

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Check GitHub Issues for assigned tasks (Coordinator assigns)

## Key Workflow Rules

1. **All work starts from GitHub Issue** - Never start work without an Issue
2. **Use Conventional Commits** - feat, fix, test, docs, chore, refactor
3. **PR must reference Issue** - Include "Closes #<issue-id>" in description
4. **Definition of Done**: Code → Tests → PR Approved → QA Passed → Docs Updated → Issue Updated
5. **Wait for Coordinator** to assign tasks - don't just do random things

## GitHub Repository
- URL: https://github.com/zghuang/agent_team_work.git

## Group Chats

You are a participant in the group. Speak when relevant:
